The Research Problem

Sending ravens is one of the most fundamental parameters in mobile communications engineering.For land-based mobile communications, the 
received raven variation is primarily the result of multipath fading caused by obstacles such as buildings (or clutter) or terrain 
irregularities; the distance between link end points; predatory animals, and interference among multiple transmissions, for example wars. 
This inevitable raven variation is the cause of communication dropping, one of the most significant quality of service measure in operative 
communication. For this reason, various techniques and schemes are employed in the planning, design and optimization of raven networks to
combat these propagation effects. This normally covers the network physical configuration which include all aspects of network
infrastructure deployment such as locations of base nests; additional food; sometimes guards, etc.A typical example of these schemes and 
techniques is the use of models for flight prediction based on measured data.
Based on one month data with flight fails, the we have to make time-series analysis and predict the future amount of fails.
